# Traceroute
A application that can map the route that data takes from our computer to a specific IP server. For each hop on the way to the destination device, traceroute provides the data's Round-Trip Time (RTT), the name and IP address of the device. As well as plot a graph that represent the average RTT in each hop.

## Motivation
The normal traceroute command is very hard to read because it is quite messy.
